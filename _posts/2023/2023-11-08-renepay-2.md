## Introduction

In an optimization problem with two *features* $$A$$ and $$B$$,
with respective cost functions $$ C_A(x) $$ and $$ C_B(x) $$.
If we combine the costs of the features linearly, ie.
such that any solution to the problem $$ x $$
has a cost $$ C(x) = C_A(x) + C_B(x) $$, we are implying that each cost unit
of feature $$ A $$ is worth one cost unit from feature $$B$$.
If an optimal solution exists $$ x_o $$
it is implied that any solution that satisfies $$ C(x') = C(x_o) $$
is as good from the point of view of the algorithm, thus any solution
that satisfies $$ C(x) = C(x_o) $$ could be found.
So for instance if we know the optimal solution achieves $$ C(x_o) = 1.0 $$
any solution $$ x_1 $$ with $$ C_A(x_1)=0.2 $$ and $$ C_B(x_1)=0.8 $$
is as good as any other solution $$ x_2 $$ with $$ C_A(x_2)=0.5 $$
and $$ C_B(x_2) = 0.5 $$.

Let's make an example: suppose we are planning for a battle strategy, 
we use a computer to find an strategy $$ x $$ such that we minimize our losses.
In order to quantify losses we define feature 
$$A$$ as the expected number of airplane lossess and $$B$$ as the number of
tank losses. The cost of the features is the amount of USD worth of losses.
So $$ C_A(x) = p_A \cdot A(x) $$, where $$p_A$$ is the price of a single
airplane and $$C_B(x)=p_B\cdot B(x)$$ is the price of a single tank.
The total cost function can be constructed as 
$$ C(x) = p_A\cdot A(x) + p_B\cdot B(x)$$, because one airplane dollar is as
good as one tank dollar. If a tank is valued at $$ p_B = 100k $$ and an airplane
is valued as $$p_A = 1M$$, a solution in which 1 aiplane and 0 tanks are lost
is as good as another solution with 0 airplanes losses but 10 tanks are lost.
You wouldn't want to define the cost as
$$ C(x) = A(x) + B(x) $$ because an airplane is worth 10 times more than
an tank, so a solution with $$ A = 1$$ and $$ B=0 $$ is a worst loss than
$$A=0$$ and $$B=1$$, even though $$ A+B=1 $$ stays the same.

In general we can estimate how many units of feature $$ A $$ are worth in terms
of feature $$ B $$ we just need to make the partial derivatives of the combined
cost function at the region of optimality:

$$
    \delta C = \frac{\partial C}{\partial A} \delta A 
        + \frac{\partial C}{\partial B} \delta B
$$

since $$ C $$ is constant in this region we have $$ \delta C = 0 $$
and we obtain

$$
    \frac{\delta A}{\delta B} = 
        - \frac{ 
            \frac{\partial C}{\partial B}
        }{
            \frac{\partial C}{\partial A}
        }
$$

the minus sign just indicates that one feature cost must increase for the other
feature cost to decrease in order to remain in the optimality region.

In the airplanes vs tanks examples the costs are linear functions, therefore we
obtain

$$
    \frac{\delta A}{\delta B} = - \frac{p_B}{p_A} = -0.1
$$

Thus, one tank is worth as much as 0.1 airplane, or 1 airplane is worth as much
as 10 tanks.

## Renepay cost function

In `renepay` we had two main features to minimize: the probability of failure
$$p$$ and the fees $$f$$. 
The cost function for the probability of failure is $$ C_p(x) = -\log(1-p(x)) $$
and the cost function of the fee is the fee itself $$ C_f(x) = f(x) $$.
We proposed a combined cost function of the form:

$$
    C(x) = -k\log(1-p(x)) + f(x)
$$

where $$ k $$ is a constant which is unspecified. 
The cost function must combine fees and uncertainty cost linearly in order to be
able to use *Minimum Cost Flows* (MCF) algorithms to find an optimal solution,
but also the linear combination seems a reasonable choice.

In an scenario where there are
no fees, an optimal solution will optimize the probability regardless of the
value of $$ k $$ (as long as $$ k>0 $$). Therefore the only true significance of
$$ k $$ is to combine fees and *uncertainty cost*. When $$ k $$ is fixed
by hand, it is implicitely carrying information about the tradeoffs of fee and
reliability (probability) we are willing to take for an optimal solution.
How much in fees are worth the probability units is given by the following
expression once we take partial derivatives of the cost function:

$$
    \delta f = \delta p \cdot \frac{k}{1-p}
$$

For instance if $$ k $$ was 1 sat and 
if the optimal solution lies around $$ p \approx 0 $$ (almost certain success)
then $$ 1\% $$ in probability is worth $$ 0.01 \times k = 100 \,\mathrm{msat} $$ in fees.

## Finding a candidate for k

One might argue that having $$ k $$ fixed is not a good approach simply because
the bigger the payment size, the payer might be willing to pay more fees in
exchange of reliability. So we proposed to write $$k$$ as the multiplication of
the payment amount $$ T $$ and a fraction $$ \alpha / 10^6 $$, with $$ \alpha $$
some integer number between 1 and $$10^6$$, in other words: parts per million.

$$
    k = T \frac{\alpha}{10^6}
$$

With this choice it follows that each unit of uncertainty is worth not a fixed
amount of sats, but a fraction of the payment amount:

$$
    10^6 \frac{\delta f}{T} = \delta p \cdot \frac{\alpha}{1-p}
$$

For example let $$\alpha = 1000$$,
then for an optimal solution, assuming $$p \approx 0$$ every $$0.1\%$$ of certainty
gained is worth 1 PPM of the payment amount that goes into fees.
In the current implementation [1] there's an extra factor called
`prob_cost_factor` with default value 10, that multiplies the uncertainty cost.
Thus the interpretation of `prob_cost_factor` is the number of PPM in equivalent
fees that we are willing to pay for each $$0.1\%$$ of improvement in 
the probability of success.

## After linearization

In a previous post [2] I have explained how linearization of the uncertainty
cost function is performed in `renepay` in order to be able to apply linear MCF
algorithms to optimize the payment. A channel with liquidity in the range $$[a,b)$$
was split into 4 arcs. The zeroth arc comprises the liquidity range with total
certainty in the range $$ [0,a) $$, the consecutive arc split the liquidity
region where all uncertainty lies in $$ [a,b) $$, see for example figure 1:

<figcaption align="center"><b>Fig. 1 - Linearized cost for a channel with bounds [3000,8000).</b></figcaption>
</figure>
The slopes of the linearized uncertainty cost function are always a constant
factor divided by the *conditional capacity* $$ b-a $$.

When we consider this linearization combined with our choice for the weight
factor `k`, we obtain for each linearized arc the following cost per unit of
flow:

$$
    k \cdot \frac{m}{b-a} = T \cdot \frac{m}{b-a}  \times 10^{-3}
$$

where $$ m $$ is the linearized cost slope for a conditional capacity of 1, ie.
$$ m = 1.38, 3.05, 9.24 $$ depending on the index of the arc.

For our MCF algorithm we work exclusively with integer numbers.
So that cost per unit of flow is an integer, the flow unit is an integer and
thus the cost is again an integer number. This gives us limited precision.
So for instance if the flow is in units of sats and the cost per unit of flow is
adimentional, we obtain a cost in sats. But a cost in sats will not be able to 
measure a cost per unit of flow of the order of the PPM, which is the usual
reference unit for the `proportional_fee`. So we have chosen to measure the cost
in micro-sats instead. This is achieved by multiplying the whole cost function
by the sats to micro-sats ratio of 1M.
Therefore the actual integer cost per unit of flow [3] is 

$$
    \left\lfloor  T \cdot \frac{m}{b-a}  \times 10^{3} 
    \cdot \mathtt{prob\_cost\_factor} \right\rfloor
$$

This cost per unit of flow becomes zero (beyond our precision) if the amount $$T$$
falls below $$ (b-a)/1000 $$, assuming we have choosen the smallest value of
`prob_cost_factor=1` and taking $$ m\approx 1 $$:

$$
    T < \frac{b-a}{1000}
$$

Which corresponds in the worst case to a channel that tries to forward the
entire amount $$T$$ through it's conditional capacity $$b-a$$, and it does with
a probability of failure $$ p \approx T/(b-a) = 10^{-3}$$, which is pretty much 
negligible and thus a zero uncertainty cost per unit of flow for this channel
is acceptable. Furthermore, if the `prob_cost_factor` is even bigger, for
example `prob_cost_factor=10` we get even a smaller limit
in precision to $$ p \approx 10^{-4} $$.
In other words: **channels with a failure probability of forwarding the
entire payment $$ p(T) $$ that fall below 
$$10^{-3}/\mathtt{prob\_cost\_factor}$$ have a zero uncertainty
cost**.
